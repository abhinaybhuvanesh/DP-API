# DP-API – Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

DP-API is a **Dynamic Programming–based REST API** that computes the  
**Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** between two numeric sequences.

This project is designed as an **academic implementation** that demonstrates the practical application of Dynamic Programming concepts through a RESTful API.

##  Input Format

Inputs are provided as **query parameters**:

- `a` → First numeric sequence (comma-separated)
- `b` → Second numeric sequence (comma-separated)

##  Algorithm Used
- **Dynamic Programming**
- Bottom-up DP table approach
